In the following exercise, you will be required to create a calendar that automatically calculates the current month and day and displays all dates in a grid format.
 

Note that you will need to organise days in a <html> table by their corresponding day of the week and the week in that month. You are supplied with both an index.html and styles.css file and are not allowed to change these.
 

You are also supplied with a scripts.js file. Note that you are only allowed to change the code between the two comments. In other words, you will primarily update the following functions:

- createData
- createCell
- createHtml

At the moment the code is broken. However, apply everything you’ve learned thus far about JavaScript to have the table render the current month you are in (dynamically) as in the example below (however note that you are most likely in a different month and not March 2023).
 

Note that you should also highlight the current day in blue. 

Summary:

- HTML and CSS are provided. Don’t change these
- Use the provided CSS classes to style the created elements
- The current month and year should be displayed above the calendar
- Each week must be indicated in the left most column (Always starts with Week 1, Week 2 etc.)
- Weeks should alternate between white and grey
- Each date of the month should be displayed under the corresponding weekday
- The current day should be highlighted in blue
